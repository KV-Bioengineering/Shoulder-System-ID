v2.0.1 ------------
- Removed BodePlot & BodePlotter functions, as they are no longer used (previously removed incorrectly, resulting in the files remaining in the commit)

v2.0.0 ------------
- The Full Data signal Length and segment length can now be user defined. Allowing for custom segmentation of the total signal, and allowing for the code to be used in other experiments
- Removed BodePlot & BodePlotter functions, as they are no longer used
- GHSysID:
    - added variables for signal length from file, and desired signal segment length
    - added UI window to get user input for above signal data
    - Data is now split into segments in this function before processing.
- dataPrep:
    - all data points are imported from lvm file to their respective variable (previously it was set to 40001 points). Signal lengths will now be handled in GHSysID
- PCalc:
    - PCalc no longer splits data into segments, this is handled in GHSysID. As such this function only does calculations for the segment passed by GHSysID

v1.1.3 ------------
- Added ability for dataPrep function to recognize the 'IE' as an experiment type in file names to allow for compatiblity with previously collected shoulder data
- Changed orientation of Parameter array in PCalc to be more consistent with other outputs

v1.1.2 ------------
- Fixed incorrect mean contraction torque values by:
    - Created new varaible to store detrended angle data
    - Created new variable to store detrended torque data
    - Transfer function estimation, Coh^2 and VAF calculations are done using these new variables.
    - Other calculations are done using the old angle and torque variables. These now contain the Angle and Torque data readings from the machine

v1.1.1 ------------
- Forgot adjust testing code before pushing v1.1.0, which caused a bug that gave Device Data a fixed path.

v1.1.0 ------------
- Added ability to select multiple experiment .lvm files to "batch process", using the previously selected device data

Todo
- Some method for reducing local minima during least squares fitting (probably using grid search method)
- Misc:
    - Clean up code & Add comments to the non-parametric VAF section
    - Comment other functions
