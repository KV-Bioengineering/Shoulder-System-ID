v1.1.0 ------------
- Added ability to select multiple experiment .lvm files to "batch process", using the previously selected device data

v1.1.1 ------------
- Forgot adjust testing code before pushing v1.1.0, which caused a bug that gave Device Data a fixed path.

v1.1.2 ------------
- Fixed incorrect mean contraction torque values by:
    - Created new varaible to store detrended angle data
    - Created new variable to store detrended torque data
    - Transfer function estimation, Coh^2 and VAF calculations are done using these new variables.
    - Other calculations are done using the old angle and torque variables. These now contain the Angle and Torque data readings from the machine

Todo
- Functions for plotting stuff
- Some method for reducing local minima during least squares fitting (probably using grid search method)
- Change to use data less than 40s. Currently assumes 40s of data (as this is the output from the robot), this is split into 10s in the PCalc step.
- Misc:
    - Clean up code & Add comments to the non-parametric VAF section
    - Comment BodePlotter functions (for required input args
    - Comment other functions
