v1.1.0 ------------
- Added ability to select multiple experiment .lvm files to "batch process", using the previously selected device data

v1.1.1 ------------
- Forgot adjust testing code before pushing v1.1.0, which caused a bug that gave Device Data a fixed path.

Todo
- Functions for plotting stuff
- Some method for reducing local minima during least squares fitting (probably using grid search method)
- Change to use data less than 40s. Currently assumes 40s of data (as this is the output from the robot), this is split into 10s in the PCalc step.
- Misc:
    - Clean up code & Add comments to the non-parametric VAF section
    - Comment BodePlotter functions (for required input args
    - Comment other functions
